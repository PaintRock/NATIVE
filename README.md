# NATIVE
Following the tutorial https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

This is my introduction to React Native, working through the tutorial and setup, fresh before completing the Atlas tasks.

<details><summary>Start UP</summary>

###Step 1

```npx create-expo-app@latest```


###Step 2

Choose a development device.  I chose my i-phone, aka IOS Device.

###Step 3

Choose to use the Expo framework or go on your own.  

I chose Expo Go

###Step 4

Copy QR code and open in App Store

###Step 5 

npx expo start

###Step 6

Got this error:

@PaintRock ➜ /workspaces/NATIVE (main) $ npx expo start
ConfigError: The expected package.json path: /workspaces/NATIVE/package.json does not exist
@PaintRock ➜ /workspaces/NATIVE (main) $

Resolved by changing into my root directory 

cd new-native

###Step 7 

Got a QR code and a page but the i-phone is not connecting to the app.  It says, taking longer than it should.  

I tried making sure that both the phone and computer are on the same wi-fi.
